### **Key Features and Functionality**

* **Problem Extraction:** Users upload an image or document (e.g., JPEG, PNG) of problems. Using **Google Cloud Vision's OCR**, **ReVision** extracts the questions, from subjects like algebra, calculus, or even code.
* **Active Practice Module:** The app builds an interactive module featuring a digital **whiteboard-style canvas**. Users write or type their solutions directly onto the canvas.
* **Real-Time AI Tutoring:** An integrated **AI Tutor** (powered by **Gemini Pro** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**) constantly monitors the user's input.
* **Instant, Tailored Feedback:** Based on the solution process, the AI provides **instant feedback, detailed breakdowns, and personalized suggestions**. Hints are color-coded (green for close, red for off-track) and displayed at the bottom.
* **Multilingual Support:** The application can reply in multiple languages, significantly expanding its accessibility.
* **Versatile Use Cases:** Excellent for students preparing for **exams** and for developers new to technologies seeking **active coding practice**.
